# My Halo 5 Stats AWS Lambda Function

This Python 3.8 function serves data from the Halo 5 Game Data API to a site I created ([My Halo 5 Stats](https://hateph34r.github.io/my-halo-5-stats/)) using AWS Lambda and AWS API gateway. This function combines 4 API queries into one JSON formatted result that is parsed by the front end.
